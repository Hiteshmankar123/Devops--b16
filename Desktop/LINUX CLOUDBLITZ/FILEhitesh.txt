           # SSH SERVICES # (Secure Shell)
           (default port number is 22)
           (first version of ssh 1995 and designed by TATU YLONEN)
           (give remotly access of two operating system)
           Two type of Authentication:-
           1. (PASSWORD BASED AUTHENTICATION)
   step 1:-  install service ssh
   step 2:-  firstly  two operating system server and client configure on single network
             check system active or not 
             systemctl status sshd      
   step 3:- Then allow the port by using firewall
            firewall-cmd --list-ports
            firewall-cmd --add-port=22/tcp
            systemctl restart sshd
            ssh root@172.25.0.10 to access for server 
            ssh root@172.25.0.15 to access for client



           2. (keybased- Authentication)
              Two keys are required :- 
              [1] public key (.pub)  [2] private key (.pem)
   step 1:-     Two operating system such as server and clint configure on single network
   step 2:-     Then allow the port by using firewall
              firewall-cmd --list-ports
              firewall-cmd --add-port=22/tcp
              systemctl restart sshd
   step 3:-   server side:-
             To generate the keys by using following cmd:-
             ssh-keygen
   step 4:-  rename the public key:-     cat id_rsa.pub > authorized_keys  
   cmd:-     chmod 600 id_rsa
             chmod 600 id_rsa.pub
             scp id_rsa root@172.25.0.15:/root (for server) 
             scp id_rsa root@172.25.0.10:/root (for client)
             Access the server:-
             ssh -i id_rsa root@172.25.0.15
             ssh -i id_rsa root@172.25.0.10 
  



            # PORT FORWARDING #
   STEP 1:- Open configuration file 
   cmd:-    vim /etc/ssh/sshd_conf
   step 2:- remove # symbol of line 17 and change port number for eg. 2020
            semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp 2020
   step 3:- systemctl restart sshd
            Add port no. to firewall
            firewall-cmd --list-ports
            firewall-cmd --permaanent --add-port=2020/tcp     
            firewall-cmd --reload      
            systemctl restart sshd
   step 4:- on client side
            ssh root@172.25.0.10 -p 2020
